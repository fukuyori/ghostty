# Windows Port Log

This log records each upstream synchronization into `windows` and the
evidence for port fixes made on `windows`. Only `windows` edits this file;
`gozitty` takes it unchanged through merges (see Section 1.2 of the
[rebranding plan](windows-rebranding-plan.md)). Newest entries come first.

## 2026-10-12: Upstream synchronization (rebranding plan Phase 0)

- **Branch:** `sync/upstream-20261012`, merged into `windows`.
- **Upstream range:** `bd1c82bc5` (2026-09-22) to `6d53bafb1` (2026-10-11),
  238 commits. `main` was fast-forwarded to `6d53bafb1`.
- **Toolchain:** Zig 0.16.0.

### Conflicts and resolutions

Upstream moved the renderer to an app-scoped `renderer.Device`, initialized
once in the core `App`, and removed the WebGL renderer.

- `src/renderer.zig`: dropped the WebGL import, kept `D3D11`, and selects
  `GraphicsAPI` from `opengl`, `metal`, and `d3d11`. `renderer.Device` is
  `GraphicsAPI.Device`.
- `src/renderer/backend.zig`: the backend enum is `opengl`, `metal`, and
  `d3d11`; Windows still defaults to `d3d11`.
- `src/renderer/D3D11.zig` and new `src/renderer/d3d11/Device.zig`: D3D11
  gets a stateless `Device` that only satisfies the interface. Each surface
  still creates its own D3D11 device and DirectComposition presenter, so
  device-loss recovery is unchanged. Sharing one D3D11 device across
  surfaces is left for a separate change.
- `src/renderer/opengl/Device.zig`: on Windows `init` leaves the device
  undefined, because Win32 uses one WGL context per surface and no EGL
  display.
- `src/renderer/OpenGL.zig`: takes the device pointer; the Windows branches
  of `init`, `deinit`, `threadEnter`, and `threadExit` never read the EGL
  fields. `present` takes upstream's new presentation-health argument and
  keeps the Windows blit path.
- `src/renderer/opengl/Frame.zig`: the Windows present call passes the
  renderer's presentation health.
- `.github/VOUCHED.td` and the flatpak, release-tag, release-tip, snap, and
  `test.yml` workflows remain deleted, as on `windows` before the merge.

The fork's ConPTY shutdown and resize handling, DEC private mode 9001,
`PageList` trailing-blank handling, and render health notifications are
preserved.

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `zig build` (Debug, D3D11) | Pass; `+version` runs |
| `zig build -Drenderer=opengl` | Pass |
| `zig fmt --check`, `git diff --check` | Pass |
| `zig build test` | Pass: 4023 passed, 62 skipped, 0 failed. The runner prints "failed command" because the upstream `TerminalFormatter` benchmark test writes to stderr; the test itself passes |
| `scripts/test-windows-window-state.ps1` | Pass: input, IME process keys, initial grid, splits and click focus, config reload, four monitors, multiple windows, maximize/minimize/restore; exit code 0, no forced termination, no leftover process |
| Codex CLI review of the merge | No regression found; one upstream feature gap (below) |

### Upstream features not yet handled on Win32

- `resize_window` (`CSI 8 ; rows ; cols t`, upstream `714fe9b90`,
  `219cca932`, `3175f6733`, `211149dbc`): the Win32 `performAction` does not
  handle it, so the request is ignored. It is gated by
  `vt-window-resize-allowed`, which defaults to `false`, so default behavior
  is unchanged. To be implemented on `windows`
  ([#45](https://github.com/fukuyori/ghostty/issues/45)).
